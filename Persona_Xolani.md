Works at Nelisa’s Cash Store

He is [Nelisa](/Persona_Nelisa.md)’s son and Ayanda’s father. A big soccer fan, sometimes plays on Saturdays.

Xolani used to have casual work as a packer, but nothing permanent. He started helping Nelisa out while he was unemployed, and it’s unofficially turned into a full time thing.
He’s usually there from 7am to 8pm during the week. He doesn’t like to be there too late, so he closes the shop around 7pm after most of the commuters are back. Then he does the shop admin before he leaves: packs up stock, adds up the sales for the day and makes a list of items they need to buy.

He knows more or less what they sell each week, but they sometimes run out of stock too quickly. It’s really frustrating when a customer wants something that’s out of stock and has to go to another spaza shop - as has been happening with [Nthabiseng](/Persona_Nthabiseng.md). He doesn’t like losing customers so sometimes he asks Nelisa to buy stock from Joe's Spaza Shop just to make sure that the customers are happy.

He has the written notes of each day's sales, but he’d like to have a better sense of what the sales of each item are over time, so that they know what to purchase for the shop. He’d also love it if he could do less admin and pack up faster in the evening.
