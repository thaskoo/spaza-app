Customer of Nelisa’s Cash Store

Nthabiseng moved to Cape Town 2 years ago with her boyfriend, and decided to stay when the relationship ended. She now lives with her cousin in Khayelitsha. She works as an Admin Assistant at a second hand furniture store in Woodstock, and commutes to work by train.

Since Nelisa’s store opened on her route from the station, it’s been a convenient stop on her way to or from work. In the morning she sometimes treats herself to a cool drink or something sweet, and she usually buys milk there on her way home. Sometimes she adds something for supper as well. 

Nthabiseng can see that Nelisa’s is getting more popular, because a few times recently they have been out of milk and a few other things by the time she gets there. This means she has to go to another spaza shop, which is annoying, so now she has to hurry from the train as well. She could change her route but it’s a bit longer so she’d prefer to buy from Nelisa’s.
